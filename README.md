<title> Talk With Your Hands  <title/>

<head/>


<body> This site is a resource for both medical personel and patients to help them bridge the communication gap between those who speak solely with their mouths, and those who primarily use ASL to talk. Many medical terms can be hard to explain and are not always lip-read with 100% accuracy, so I built this resource to leand a helping hand. Please let me know if you have any comments, questions, or just general feedback. Thank you for visiting!  <body/>
